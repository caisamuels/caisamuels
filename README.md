# Hi there, I'm Cai! 👋

I'm a passionate and dedicated **Software Developer** from North Wales, bringing a strong academic background and a keen interest in modern technologies. I recently graduated with a **first-class degree in Computer Science**, where I developed a solid foundation in software engineering principles and practices.

## About Me

- 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 Based in Wales
- 🎓 First-class BSc (Hons) in Computer Science
- 💻 Interested in Web Development and Machine Learning
- 🌱 Always learning and exploring new technologies

## My Projects

I enjoy building projects that solve real-world problems. One of my recent projects is a [**Traffic Monitoring System**](https://github.com/caisamuels/traffic-monitoring-system). This system uses computer vision to detect and track vehicles in a live video stream, estimate their speed, and log the data in real-time. It integrates a YOLO model for object detection and logs data asynchronously to a MongoDB database.
